Learn More
----------
You should check out the wiki for more information:
https://github.com/negative11/negative11-chocolate/wiki

There you will find detailed installation and setup instructions.

Requirements
------------
PHP Version 5.3+
Apache Web Server with mod_rewrite enabled (if using included .htaccess file).

Basic Installation
------------------
It's very easy to get started.

1. Set application directory as your website root. It is recommended that you keep all other folders
outside of the public web directory.
2. Open index.php and modifiy contents. Follow instructions for specifying environment paths and 
packages.
3. Open your browser and point to website. If you have everything configured correctly, you should 
see the framework information page.
4. If you have difficulties, refer to the full installation guide in the wiki.

Common Problems
---------------
If you get a 500 error when trying to load the framework, it is possible that mod_rewrite is not 
enabled. Check your Apache configuration.

If you don't see the framework page, ensure that you specified your paths correctly in index.php, 
and that the user running Apache has the correct permissions to load the files. 

Apache Issues
-------------
If you see a 404 page when loading website for the first time, ensure that the ENVIRONMENT_ROOT in 
index.php is defined to the absolute path of the folder that contains the system and packages 
folders. 

Ensure that mod_rewrite is enabled and that your .htaccess is set to the values provided. 

Your Apache virtual host must be set up to point the accessed domain at the appropriate folder, as 
the .htaccess file uses '/' as the RewriteBase 
(@see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritebase for more information 
regarding RewriteBase). 
You must set the AllowOverride All directive to enable .htaccess for the project.

Sample Apache Virtual Host
--------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/example/application
  ServerName example.com
  <Directory /var/www/example/application>
  	AllowOverride All
    allow from all
    Options +Indexes
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Shared Hosting Environments
---------------------------
If you can't seem to load any pages beyond the front page, or if you always see the front page 
regardless of path, it is possible that $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] is not set to the expected value. This
is very common in shared hosting environments. In system/core/kickstart.php you may select a 
different variable as a workaround (either PATH_INFO or REQUEST_URI). The variable you select
(PHP_SELF by default) is used to during framework routing to determine which controller should
be loaded. 

Note that changing the default variable may break usage of the framework via CLI, as the chosen 
variable may not be available to the command line.
